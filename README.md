# javaRSA

javaRSA is a simple RSA implementation in Java, for educational purposes only.
This project was created for fun and practice, and roughly follows the scheme
devised by the original paper by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.

Under no circumstances should javaRSA be considered secure or usable for any
real software, except for demonstration purposes of its underlying mathematics.
